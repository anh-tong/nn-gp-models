# Motivations

Gaussian Process is known as a smooth curve-fitting method, having algorithmic tractibilities as well as captivate model uncertainty calibrations.

Neural network, on the other hand, has impressive demonstrations in learning features from data.

This repo aims to collect some interesting models in which both properties are attained.

# Dependencies

Models in this repo will be developed either in GPflow or GPytorch. It will further specify per model.
